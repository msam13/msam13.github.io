## Knowledge Representation: A Semantic Network Approach

**Abstract:**
Knowledge representation is an emerging field of research in Artificial Intelligence, Big Data analytics, Semantic Web, and Data Mining. Effective knowledge representation facilitates easy traversal, searching, reasoning, prediction, and inference. Various approaches, algorithms, techniques, and models have been proposed, each with its own advantages and limitations. Our aim is to propose a simple yet highly effective method for representing knowledge, which offers greater expressiveness compared to logic and resonates with human cognitive processes. This paper discusses the implementation of a semantic network using a straightforward yet powerful method that yields accurate results despite the inherent vagueness of the English language. We detail the patterns discovered in sentences and the use of Natural Language Toolkit and Part-of-Speech tagging to simplify the task of tagging words with their respective parts of speech.
