## About Me

    <h1>Hi, I'm Samridha Murali!</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Samridha Murali. Welcome to my portfolio. On the right is a photo of me from March 2024, when I visited San Francisco for the first time. I loved the Californian energy, so post-graduation I moved to THE SILICON VALLEY. The past doesn't matter, but anyways, a little about my past: I graduated from [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) with a Master's degree in Engineering (Cyber Security and Software Engineering). At the University of Maryland, I worked at [CATT labs](https://www.cattlab.umd.edu/). During the pandemic, I did a lot, including an awesome internship at Honeywell & HPE, published a [paper](https://www.ijeat.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v10i1/A17981010120.pdf), and also finished my Bachelor's degree at [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html). Always spreading [love](#).
